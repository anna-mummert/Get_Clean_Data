 Getting and Cleaning Data, Coursera
 A Mummert, 2021.12.20

## Data cleaning steps

 * Read in the subject, activity, and measurements data for both test and training data sets
 * Combine the subject, activity, and measurement data into a combined data set, using cbind
    * combined_test (2947 observations of 563 variables)
    * combined_train (7352 observations of 563 variables)
 * Combine combined_test and combined_train, using rbind
    * combined_data (10299 observations of 563 variables)
 * Read in the features.txt data set and set as column names, using colnames
 * Select columns with column names "subject", "activity", or containing "mean" or "std", using select
    * combined_data (10299 observations of 88 variables)
 * Change subject and activity to factor variables, using as.factor
 * Recode the activities to descriptive labels, using recode
 * Compute mean of each measurement variable per subject, per activity, using group_by and summarize
    * mean_data (180 observations of 88 variables)
 * Export mean_data to .txt file, using write.table


## Variables in combined_* and mean_data data sets

1 subject : factor variable for subjects 1 to 30
2 activity : factor variable with factors
    * walking
    * walk_up = walking upstairs
    * walk_down = walking downstairs
    * sitting
    * standing
    * laying

# Variable information from 'features_info.txt' (please see that file for more information)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
